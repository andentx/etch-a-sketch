## Notes

This is a project from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject)'s foundations track.

I built this early on in my coding journey to learn about the fundamentals of web development. I gained experience manipulating the DOM and controlling the UI with JavaScript.

## Features

-   Draw with CSS and JavaScript
-   Choose colors for draw, frame and background
-   Multiple color modes:
    -   **Solid** - Selected color
    -   **Shade** - Selected color, increases opacity by 10%
    -   **Random** - Random color

    -   **Sand** - Colors of sand

-   Toggle switch to hide or show grid lines
-   Set grid size from 2x2 to 100x100 squares
-   Clear screen button
-   Responsive design

## What's Next

-   **Adding touchscreen functionality** - I haven't been able to figure out how to properly use touch event listeners to achieve the same functionality as the mouse events.

-   **Adding different color palettes** - The ones added right now are to quickly draw a beach, but that's about it.

-   **Improving over time** - This was a project I built early on in my coding journey. I might revist it to make improvements or try something new I've learned. For now, I will keep it as something to document my progress learning web development.
